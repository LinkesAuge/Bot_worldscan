## Development Guidelines

### Multi-Language Support Guidelines
1. **String Externalization**:
   - All user-visible text must be wrapped in translation functions
   - Use context where helpful (e.g., `tr("Open", "Menu")` vs `tr("Open", "Dialog")`)
   - Handle plurals properly (`tr("%n item(s) found", "", count)`)

2. **Layout Considerations**:
   - German text can be 20-30% longer than English
   - Use layouts that can accommodate variable text lengths
   - Test UI with both languages

3. **Testing**:
   - Test all UI components in both languages
   - Test language switching during runtime
   - Test with system language set to each supported language

4. **Maintenance**:
   - Re-extract strings when adding new UI components
   - Update translations before releases
   - Document procedures for adding new languages
