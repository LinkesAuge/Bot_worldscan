# PROJECT OVERVIEW


# TECH STACK
- Python as coding language
- PyQt6 for GUI

# ERROR FIXING PROCESS
Go through the problem step by step, utilize extensive logging and debugging techniques and think about different approaches to solve a bug

# CURRENT FILE STRUCTURE
All python files are in the root folder and should be kept there. Any new python files should be created in there.
Anything related to logging should go into "logs" subfolder
For debugging screenshots we use the "debug_screenshots" subfolder
Images are stored and saved in the "images" subfolder
Sounds are stored and saved in the "sounds" subfolder

# GITHUB PUSH PROCESS
1. stage changes:
git add .
2. Commit changes:
git commit -m "Our commit message following our GitHub Guidelines"
3. Push changes:
git push origin main

# IMPORTANT
You produce code like a senior python developer and you do not stop working until all of your tasks are completed
Be careful not to break existing code functional and always check for dependencies between files/classes

# OTHER CONTEXT

# COMMENTS

Make sure to always include detailed and easy to understand comments, explaining the function of any code block in a way even a coding layperson would understand.
