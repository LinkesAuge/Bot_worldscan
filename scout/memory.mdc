## 2023-07-14: Strict Coordinate Format Enforcement

### Changes Made
- Modified the coordinate extraction to strictly enforce the expected format of `K: 000 X: 000 Y: 000`
- Updated the text scoring system to heavily prioritize text matching the expected format
- Added a more specific OCR configuration to improve recognition of the expected format
- Simplified text cleaning to focus only on essential character replacements
- Added clear validation of coordinate values to ensure they are within valid ranges
- Improved logging to clearly indicate when text doesn't match the expected format

### Impact
- More reliable coordinate extraction by rejecting invalid formats
- Reduced false positives in coordinate recognition
- Clearer error messages when coordinates can't be extracted
- Improved consistency in coordinate extraction
- Better debugging capabilities with enhanced logging of rejected formats

### Testing
- Verified that only text matching the expected format is accepted
- Confirmed that invalid coordinate formats are properly rejected
- Tested that the scoring system correctly prioritizes the expected format
- Checked that coordinate values are properly validated

## 2023-07-13: OCR Text Extraction Improvements

### Changes Made
- Fixed the whitelist configuration in the OCR process by removing problematic quotation marks
- Enhanced text cleaning to handle game-specific OCR errors (e.g., "geeX" instead of "X", "MEY" instead of "Y")
- Added a new preprocessing method using image sharpening for better text definition
- Improved the scoring system to better identify valid coordinate text
- Added more robust regex patterns for coordinate extraction
- Enhanced the text selection algorithm to skip invalid results and prioritize complete coordinates
- Updated the OCR method dropdown in the GUI to include the new sharpened method
- Added more comprehensive logging of OCR results and preprocessing steps

### Impact
- More reliable coordinate extraction from the game UI
- Better handling of OCR misrecognitions specific to the game
- Improved text preprocessing for clearer character recognition
- More accurate scoring and selection of OCR results
- Reduced errors in the OCR process
- Better debugging capabilities with enhanced logging

### Testing
- Verified that coordinates are correctly extracted from the game UI
- Tested the new sharpened preprocessing method
- Confirmed that the text cleaning properly handles common OCR errors
- Checked that the scoring system correctly identifies valid coordinate text
- Verified that the OCR process no longer fails due to configuration errors

## OCR System and Game World Search Integration Fixes (2023-07-10)

### Changes Made
- Fixed the OCR system integration with the game world search functionality
- Ensured consistent screenshot capture and saving for debugging purposes
- Modified `GameWorldCoordinator.update_current_position_from_ocr()` to properly utilize the TextOCR system
- Enhanced the `GameWorldSearch._check_for_templates()` method to always save screenshots for debugging
- Improved the `CoordinateDisplayWidget._update_coordinates()` method to handle different coordinate sources
- Added additional logging for better debugging of coordinate updates
- Ensured the game world search tab properly updates when coordinates change

### Impact
- The OCR system now consistently extracts and displays coordinates from the game UI
- Debug screenshots are saved with consistent naming for easier comparison
- The game world search functionality now reliably updates coordinates during searches
- Coordinate display is more robust and handles edge cases better

### Testing
- Verified that coordinates are properly extracted and displayed in the game world search tab
- Confirmed that screenshots are saved during template searches regardless of settings
- Tested that the coordinate display widget updates correctly when coordinates change
