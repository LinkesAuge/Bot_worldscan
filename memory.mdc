## OCR System Integration Fix
- **Issue**: The OCR system had two separate processing paths - one in TextOCR._process_region() and another in GameWorldCoordinator.update_current_position_from_ocr(). This caused inconsistent results and made debugging difficult.
- **Solution**: 
  - Modified GameWorldCoordinator.update_current_position_from_ocr() to use TextOCR's region and processing method
  - Updated TextOCR._process_region() to save debug images with consistent naming
  - Ensured all OCR processing goes through the same code path
- **Impact**: This fix ensures that both the "old" OCR system and the game world search use the same OCR processing path, reducing redundancy and ensuring consistent results.
- **Testing**: Verify that the OCR system now produces consistent results and debug screenshots.

## Search Pattern Functionality
- Implemented four different search pattern generators:
  - **Spiral Pattern**: Starts from a center point and spirals outward, covering the area in a spiral motion
  - **Grid Pattern**: Systematically covers a rectangular area in a grid pattern, with optional snake-like traversal
  - **Expanding Circles Pattern**: Generates points in concentric circles around a center point
  - **Quadtree Pattern**: Recursively divides the search space into quadrants, checking the center of each quadrant
- Created a utility class `SearchPatternAutomation` that integrates search patterns with the automation system
- Added a dialog for configuring and creating search pattern sequences with customizable parameters
- Implemented pattern visualization for debugging and preview purposes
- Integrated search pattern creation into the automation tab with a dedicated button
- Fixed UI integration by properly initializing the automation manager and calling the create_scan_controls method

- Attempted to improve OCR preprocessing by prioritizing Otsu's thresholding, but reverted changes as they made the issue worse
- Reverted changes to coord_region.png processing as they caused issues with coordinate extraction

## OCR Screenshot Region Issue
- Fixed issue where OCR debug screenshots were being taken from different regions, causing confusion and making debugging difficult.
  - Root cause: The code had two separate screenshot capture paths - one in `GameWorldCoordinator` that correctly cropped the coordinate region, and another in `TextOCR._process_region()` that took a separate screenshot using screen coordinates.
  - Solution: Refactored the OCR processing to centralize all image processing in the `TextOCR.extract_text()` method, ensuring consistent debug screenshots and improving the OCR process.
  - Implementation:
    - Enhanced `TextOCR.extract_text()` with multiple preprocessing techniques and a scoring system
    - Refactored `TextOCR._process_region()` to use the enhanced `extract_text()` method
    - Improved `TextOCR._extract_coordinates()` to handle more coordinate formats
    - Added consistent debug image naming and saving
  - Impact: Debug screenshots now consistently show the same region, making it easier to diagnose OCR issues. The OCR process is also more robust with better preprocessing and coordinate extraction.
  - Testing: Verified that all debug screenshots (`coord_region.png`, `OCR Region.png`, `OCR Extract.png`, etc.) now show the same region and that the OCR process correctly extracts coordinates.

## Increment Per Loop Feature
- Each action can now have "use_increment" flag and "increment" value
- When enabled, the repeat count is multiplied by (loop_count * increment_value)
- Example: If repeat=2, loop_count=3, increment=1, effective repeat count is 6
- The loop count is tracked in the ExecutionContext and incremented each time a sequence completes
- The UI displays increment information in the action list

## Implementation Details
- Added use_increment (bool) and increment (int) fields to all parameter classes
- Updated BaseParamsWidget to include UI controls for these fields
- Added loop_count tracking to ExecutionContext
- Modified SequenceExecutor._execute_next_step to calculate effective repeat count

## Bug Fixes
- **Positions Reappearing After Removal**: Fixed issue with positions.json file corruption where the file contained multiple duplicate copies of the same JSON object. This caused positions to reappear after being removed when the application was restarted. The file has been cleaned up to contain only one valid JSON object.
  - Root cause: The file writing process was likely appending new data to the file instead of replacing it, resulting in duplicate JSON objects.
  - Solution: Manually cleaned up the positions.json file to contain only one valid JSON object with the correct positions.
  - Future prevention: Consider adding validation when reading/writing the positions.json file to detect and prevent corruption.

- **Position Name Synchronization**: Fixed issue where position names in the UI were not properly synchronized with the internal name field in the position objects, causing a mismatch between the UI display and the stored data.
  - Root cause: When positions were renamed in the UI, the key in the positions dictionary was updated, but the internal name field in the position object was not.
  - Solution: Updated the code to ensure that when a position is renamed, both the dictionary key and the internal name field are updated to match.
  - Implementation: Modified the position handling code in multiple places to ensure proper synchronization:
    - Updated _on_details_changed to set position.name when renaming
    - Updated _on_remove_clicked to properly save positions after removal
    - Updated _load_configurations and _load_saved_data to ensure name synchronization when loading positions
    - Improved position creation to use unique names and avoid conflicts

- **Search Pattern UI Integration**: Fixed issue where the search pattern button was not appearing in the automation tab UI.
  - Root cause: The create_scan_controls method was defined but not called during initialization of the AutomationTab class.
  - Solution: Updated the AutomationTab.__init__ method to call create_scan_controls and properly initialize the automation manager.
  - Implementation: Modified the AutomationTab class to:
    - Initialize the automation_manager in __init__
    - Call create_scan_controls to add the search pattern button to the UI
    - Update all methods to use the automation_manager for position management

- **Missing OCR Methods**: Fixed issue where the OCR-related methods were referenced in the create_scan_controls method but not defined in the AutomationTab class.
  - Root cause: The methods were referenced in the UI setup but not implemented in the class.
  - Solution: Added the missing methods with placeholder implementations.
  - Implementation: Added the following methods to the AutomationTab class:
    - _toggle_ocr: Toggles OCR functionality on/off (placeholder implementation)
    - _start_ocr_region_selection: Starts OCR region selection (placeholder implementation)
    - on_ocr_slider_change: Handles OCR frequency slider changes
    - on_ocr_spinbox_change: Handles OCR frequency spinbox changes
    - Fixed the layout structure in create_scan_controls to properly add the frequency controls

- **Import Issues**: Fixed import issues with the new game world search modules.
  - Root cause: The `scout/gui` directory was not a proper Python package.
  - Solution: Added an `__init__.py` file to make it a proper package.
  - Implementation: Created an `__init__.py` file in the `scout/gui` directory with a package docstring.

- **Missing TextOCR extract_text Method**: Fixed issue where the `GameWorldCoordinator` class was trying to call `extract_text()` on the `TextOCR` object, but this method didn't exist in the `TextOCR` class.
  - Root cause: Mismatch between the `GameWorldCoordinator` implementation and the `TextOCR` class interface.
  - Solution: Added a new `extract_text(image: np.ndarray) -> str` method to the `TextOCR` class.
  - Implementation: 
    - Added a method that takes an image and returns the extracted text
    - Implemented image preprocessing (grayscale conversion, contrast enhancement, noise reduction)
    - Added proper error handling and logging
    - Included debug visualization support for the extracted text
    - Ensured the method follows the same image processing pipeline as the existing OCR functionality

- **Missing cv2 Import in GameWorldSearch**: Fixed issue where the `game_world_search.py` file was missing the cv2 import, causing errors when checking for templates.
  - Root cause: The file was using OpenCV functions (cv2) for image processing and saving screenshots, but the module was not imported.
  - Solution: Added `import cv2` statement at the top of the file.
  - Implementation: Added the import after the other standard library imports and verified that the application runs without the "name 'cv2' is not defined" error.
  - Impact: This fix resolves the runtime errors that were occurring in the `_check_for_templates` method, specifically at line 375 where `cv2.imwrite()` was being called to save screenshots. The application now runs smoothly without these errors, allowing the game world search functionality to work properly.
  - Testing: Verified that the application starts correctly and the game world search tab functions without errors. The screenshot saving functionality now works as expected when templates are being searched for in the game world.

- **Coordinate Display Issues**: Fixed multiple issues with coordinate display in both the overlay tab and game world search tab.
  - Root cause: Several issues were identified:
    - The `CoordinateDisplayWidget` class was displaying coordinates in the wrong order (X, Y, K instead of K, X, Y)
    - Coordinates were not properly formatted with a maximum of 3 digits
    - Coordinates were not being updated in the game world search tab
    - Coordinates were not being validated to ensure they are within valid ranges
  - Solution: Updated multiple classes to fix these issues:
    - Updated the `CoordinateDisplayWidget` class to display coordinates in the correct order (K, X, Y)
    - Updated the `GameCoordinates.__str__` and `GameWorldPosition.__str__` methods to format coordinates with a maximum of 3 digits
    - Updated the `_update_coordinates_display` method in the `OverlayController` class to format coordinates properly
    - Updated the `_update_coordinates` method in the `CoordinateDisplayWidget` class to format coordinates properly
    - Added the `_on_coordinates_updated` method to the `GameWorldSearchTab` class and connected it to the `coordinates_updated` signal from the `TextOCR` class
    - Updated the `_process_region` and `_extract_coordinates` methods in `TextOCR` to ensure proper signal emission
    - Added more comprehensive logging throughout the OCR process for better debugging
    - Improved error handling in coordinate extraction and display
    - Added fallback to display last known coordinates when OCR fails
