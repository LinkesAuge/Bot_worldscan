# Scout Test Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive testing approach for Scout 1.0.0, ensuring all components function correctly before release.

## Testing Strategy Overview

Our testing strategy employs a multi-layered approach to ensure the highest quality:

2. **Integration Testing**: Testing interactions between components
3. **System Testing**: Testing the application as a whole
4. **Performance Testing**: Measuring and optimizing performance
5. **Cross-Platform Testing**: Ensuring compatibility across operating systems
6. **User Acceptance Testing**: Validating against user requirements

## Test Environment Setup
