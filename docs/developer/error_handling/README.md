# Error Reporting and Recovery System

## Overview

The Error Reporting and Recovery System in Scout provides robust mechanisms for detecting, logging, and recovering from errors throughout the application. This system aims to improve application stability, provide meaningful feedback to users, and collect diagnostic information for developers.

## Design Goals

The Scout Error Reporting and Recovery System is designed with the following goals in mind:

1. **Graceful Error Handling**: Prevent application crashes and provide meaningful error messages to users.
2. **Comprehensive Logging**: Record detailed information about errors and application state.
3. **Automatic Recovery**: Attempt to recover from non-critical errors automatically.
4. **Error Reporting**: Allow users to submit error reports to developers.
5. **Diagnostics**: Collect relevant system and application information for troubleshooting.

## Core Components

The system consists of the following key components:

### 1. Logger

A centralized logging system that records application events, warnings, and errors to:
- Log files with rotating policies
- Console output
- Remote logging service (optional)

### 2. Error Handler

Intercepts exceptions and processes them based on severity:
- **Critical**: Application cannot continue running
- **Severe**: Major feature is unusable, but application can still run
- **Warning**: Non-critical issue that may affect functionality
- **Info**: Informational message that doesn't indicate an error

### 3. Recovery System

Attempts to restore application state after errors by:
- Retrying failed operations
- Reloading corrupted data
- Resetting malfunctioning components
- Falling back to alternative implementations

### 4. Error Reporter

Collects diagnostic information and facilitates error reporting:
- System information
- Application configuration
- Error details with stack traces
- User-provided description of the issue

### 5. User Interface Components

UI elements that interact with users when errors occur:
- Error dialog boxes
- Status bar notifications
- Progress indicators with error states
- Recovery progress feedback

## Quick Start Guide

To get started with the Error Reporting and Recovery System, follow these basic steps:

1. **Initialize the system components**:

```python
from scout.core.error_reporting import setup_error_handling

# Setup error handling components
logger, error_handler, recovery_system, error_reporter = setup_error_handling()
```

2. **Use the error handler in your code**:

```python
try:
    # Attempt an operation
    result = some_operation()
    return result
except SpecificException as e:
    # Handle specific exception
    context = {
        "operation": "some_operation",
        "retry_function": some_operation,
        "show_error_dialog": True
    }
    if error_handler.handle_exception(e, ErrorSeverity.WARNING, context):
        # Recovered successfully
        return some_operation()
    return None
```

3. **Register custom error handlers for specific exceptions**:

```python
def handle_custom_error(exception, context):
    # Custom recovery logic here
    return recovery_successful  # Return True if recovered

error_handler.register_handler(CustomException, handle_custom_error)
```

4. **Show error dialog for critical errors**:

```python
from scout.ui.dialogs.error_dialog import ErrorDialog

def on_critical_error(exception, error_message):
    dialog = ErrorDialog(
        exception=exception,
        error_message=error_message,
        error_reporter=error_reporter
    )
    dialog.exec()
```
