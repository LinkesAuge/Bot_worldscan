# Distribution Channels for Scout

This document outlines the distribution strategy for the Scout application across various platforms, including how releases are managed, distributed, and updated.

## Overview

The Scout application is distributed through multiple channels to reach users on different platforms. The primary distribution channels include:

1. **GitHub Releases** - Primary distribution channel for all platforms
2. **Website Downloads** - Official website download section
3. **Update System** - In-app updates for existing installations

   - Manual installation option
   - Includes setup script for basic integration

## GitHub Release Process

GitHub Releases serves as our primary distribution platform. Each release follows these steps:

1. **Release Preparation**
   - Update version numbers across all components
   - Prepare release notes documenting changes, improvements, and fixes
   - Tag the release commit in Git with the version number

2. **Building Release Assets**
   - Build executables and installers for all target platforms
   - Generate SHA256 checksums for all assets
   - Prepare release packages

3. **Publishing the Release**
   - Create a new GitHub Release with the prepared tag
   - Upload all built assets to the release
   - Publish detailed release notes
   - Mark as pre-release or production release as appropriate

4. **Release Announcement**
   - Update the official website with release information
   - Send email notification to subscribers (future)
   - Post announcements on relevant forums/communities (future)

## Website Distribution

The official Scout website will serve as the secondary distribution channel:

1. **Download Page Structure**
   - Clear platform detection and suggestion
   - Direct links to the latest version for each platform
   - Access to previous versions
   - System requirements information

2. **Download Analytics**
   - Basic analytics to track download numbers
   - Platform popularity tracking
   - No personal data collection

3. **Documentation**
   - Installation guides for each platform
   - Quick start guide prominently featured
   - FAQ section for common installation issues

## Update System Integration

The in-app update system connects to the GitHub Releases API to check for and download updates:

1. **Update Check Process**
   - Application periodically checks for updates based on user preferences
   - Compares local version with the latest release version
   - Notifies user when an update is available

2. **Update Delivery**
   - Direct download of the appropriate update package
   - Verification of download integrity via checksums
   - Installation/upgrade process appropriate to the platform

3. **Update Configuration**
   - User-configurable update checking frequency
   - Option to automatically download updates
   - Release channel selection (stable vs. beta)

## Security Considerations

Security is a critical component of our distribution strategy:

1. **File Integrity**
   - All distributed files include SHA256 checksums
   - Update mechanism verifies file integrity before installation

2. **Code Signing** (future enhancement)
   - Windows executables and installers will be signed with a code signing certificate
   - macOS application bundles will be signed and notarized with Apple

3. **Secure Downloads**
   - All downloads are served over HTTPS
   - GitHub's secure infrastructure ensures secure delivery

## Future Distribution Channels

Additional distribution channels planned for future releases:

1. **Package Managers**
   - Windows: Microsoft Store
   - macOS: Homebrew
   - Linux: Distribution-specific repositories

2. **Direct Update Server**
   - Custom update server infrastructure
   - More detailed update analytics
   - Delta updates to reduce download size

## Release Cadence

The release schedule follows these general principles:

1. **Major Releases (x.0.0)**
   - Significant new features
   - Possible architectural changes
   - Thorough testing period with beta releases
   - Comprehensive documentation updates
