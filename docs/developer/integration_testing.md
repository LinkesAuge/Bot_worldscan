# Integration Testing

This document outlines the integration testing strategy for the Scout application to ensure all components work together correctly before the final release.

## Overview

Integration testing verifies that different modules or services used by the Scout application work well together. Unlike unit testing, which focuses on individual components, integration testing focuses on the interactions between components.

## Integration Test Strategy

The Scout application uses a multi-level integration testing approach:

1. **Component Integration Testing**: Verifies that related components within a module integrate correctly
2. **Module Integration Testing**: Verifies that different modules integrate correctly
3. **System Integration Testing**: Verifies end-to-end workflows across the entire application
4. **External Integration Testing**: Verifies integration with external systems (game windows, OS services)

## Key Integration Points

The Scout application has several critical integration points that require thorough testing:

### 1. Window Service ↔ Detection Service
- Window capture provides images to detection strategies
- Results of detection are visualized on window overlays

### 2. Detection Service ↔ Game Service
- Detection results feed into game state analysis
- Game state influences detection parameters

### 3. Game Service ↔ Automation Service
- Game state triggers automation actions
- Automation results update game state

### 4. UI ↔ Core Services
- UI components correctly interact with underlying services
- Services provide appropriate notifications to UI

### 5. Error Handling Integration
- Error handler correctly intercepts exceptions from all components
- Recovery strategies are correctly applied across components

### 6. Update System Integration
- Update checker interacts correctly with UI
- Application handles update installation process correctly

## Test Environments

Integration tests should be executed in the following environments:

1. **Development Environment**: During development to catch integration issues early
2. **Testing Environment**: Clean environment to simulate fresh installation
3. **Production-like Environment**: Simulates actual user configurations

Each environment should test on all supported platforms:
- Windows 10/11
- macOS
- Linux (Ubuntu LTS)

## Integration Test Cases

| GA-INT-002 | Automation updates game state | Running automation sequence | 1. Run automation sequence<br>2. Check game state updates | Game state updated after automation completes |
| GA-INT-003 | Conditional automation based on state | Sequence with conditions | 1. Run sequence with conditions<br>2. Vary game state | Sequence behaves differently based on state |

### UI Integration

| Test ID | Description | Prerequisites | Steps | Expected Result |
|---------|-------------|---------------|-------|----------------|
| UI-INT-001 | Settings changes affect services | Running application | 1. Change detection settings<br>2. Run detection | Detection uses new settings |
| UI-INT-002 | Service events update UI | Running application | 1. Trigger detection<br>2. Check UI updates | Results appear in UI immediately |
| UI-INT-003 | Error reporting in UI | Triggered error condition | 1. Cause deliberate error<br>2. Check error display | Error dialog shows with correct info |

### End-to-End Workflows

| Test ID | Description | Prerequisites | Steps | Expected Result |
|---------|-------------|---------------|-------|----------------|
| E2E-001 | Resource collection workflow | Configured game window | 1. Detect resources<br>2. Create automation<br>3. Run automation<br>4. Verify results | Full workflow completes successfully |
| E2E-002 | Building upgrade workflow | Configured game window | 1. Detect buildings<br>2. Create upgrade sequence<br>3. Run automation<br>4. Verify upgrades | Buildings are upgraded through automation |
| E2E-003 | Error recovery during workflow | Configured error trigger | 1. Start workflow<br>2. Trigger error<br>3. Check recovery | Error handled and workflow recovers |

## Testing Tools

The following tools are used for integration testing:

1. **Pytest Integration**: Framework for writing and executing integration tests
2. **Mock Objects**: For simulating external dependencies 
3. **UI Test Helpers**: For automating UI interactions during testing
4. **Test Data Generators**: For creating test data for various scenarios

## Integration Test Execution

### Test Setup

For each integration test:

1. Initialize the application with a clean state
2. Configure required prerequisites
3. Connect to relevant event handlers for verification

### Test Execution

1. Execute the integration test steps in sequence
2. Record results at each step
3. Capture screenshots for UI-related tests
4. Log all relevant events and service interactions

### Test Verification

1. Verify each component's state after interactions
2. Check that data flows correctly between components
3. Verify error handling across component boundaries
4. Verify system-wide state consistency

## Continuous Integration

Integration tests should be run:

1. After any significant component change
2. Before merging features into the main branch
3. As part of nightly builds
4. Before release candidates

## Troubleshooting Integration Issues

When integration issues arise:

1. **Identify the boundary**: Determine which components are involved
2. **Check interfaces**: Verify that interfaces match between components
3. **Verify data**: Check data transformation between components
4. **Check timing**: Look for race conditions or timing issues
5. **Review error handling**: Ensure errors propagate correctly
6. **Check resource cleanup**: Verify resources are properly released

## Reporting Integration Test Results

Integration test results should be documented with:

1. Test case ID and description
2. Test environment details
3. Actual results vs. expected results
4. Screenshots or logs of failures
5. Recommendations for fixing failures

## Integration Testing Checklist

Before releasing the application, verify:

- [ ] All component integration tests pass
- [ ] All module integration tests pass
- [ ] All system integration tests pass
- [ ] All end-to-end workflows function correctly
- [ ] Error handling is consistent across components
- [ ] Performance is acceptable across integration points
- [ ] Resource management works correctly across components

## Conclusion

Integration testing is crucial for ensuring that the Scout application functions correctly as a whole system. This document provides a framework for verifying that all components work together seamlessly before the final release.
