Your new template will now appear in the template list in the Detection Tab.

## Basic Workflow Example

Let's put everything together with a basic workflow example for detecting and clicking on a resource:

1. Create a template for the resource (e.g., gold mine) using the Template Creator.
2. In the Detection Tab, select Template Matching and your new template.
3. Run the detection to verify that the resource is found correctly.
4. Switch to the Automation Tab and create a new sequence.
5. Add a "Click" action targeting the template you created.
6. Save and run the sequence.
7. The application will detect the resource and click on it automatically.
